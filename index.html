            <h2>Introduction to Sharks</h2>
            <p>
              Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a
              cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of
              the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head. Modern
              sharks are classified within the clade Selachimorpha (or Selachii)
              and are the sister group to the Batoidea (rays and kin). Some
              sources extend the term "shark" as an informal category including
              extinct members of Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish) with a
              shark-like morphology, such as hybodonts. Shark-like
              chondrichthyans such as Cladoselache and Doliodus first appeared
              in the Devonian Period (419–359 million years), though some
              fossilized chondrichthyan-like scales are as old as the Late
              Ordovician (458–444 million years ago).[1] The oldest modern
              sharks (selachimorphs) are known from the Early Jurassic, about
              200 million years ago. Several species are apex predators, which
              are organisms that are at the top of their food chain. Select
              examples include the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark,
              mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark.
